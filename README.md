# Cloning a beautiful website layout with html and css

## The Site
#### www.bairlymedia.com

I decided on cloning this site because the layout caught my eye.  The landing page is dynamic with a mixture of videos, photographs, and animation.  As you scroll down, each page section highlights an important part of the owner's wedding photography and videography business.  The sections flow together well, but have distinct styling.

### Working Session 1

#### Getting Started

I set up my new repository starting in VSCode with creating a new project folder and initializing it as a github repository.  I then added my html and css boilerplates.  Adding the basic html architecture included adding a <header> with two <nav> elements, a <main> with two <section> elements (one for above the fold and one for the rest of the site), and a footer.
